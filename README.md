## Overview

Alp's Creative Building Modpack is a client-side Fabric modpack for Minecraft 1.21.X, meticulously curated to enhance the creative building experience.

## ✨ Core Features

---

## ⚙️ Recommended Settings

* **Suggested RAM:** 6GB (Allocate 6144MB in your launcher).
* **Note on RAM:** Allocating significantly more RAM (e.g., 10GB+) might negatively impact performance due to Java's garbage collection, unless you are using very high-resolution resource packs alongside this modpack. 6GB is generally sufficient for a smooth experience with the included mods and shaders.
